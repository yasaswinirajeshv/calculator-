# Tkinter-Based Calculator App

This is a simple graphical calculator app built using Python's Tkinter library.

## How to Use
1. Make sure you’re running this on a local machine with a graphical interface (like your PC — Google Colab won’t support Tkinter).
2. Run the Python script.
3. A calculator window will pop up.
4. Click the buttons to enter numbers and operations.
5. Press `=` to see the result.
6. Click `Clear` to reset the calculator.

## Examples
```
Click: 5, +, 3, =
Result: 8

Click: 12, /, 4, =
Result: 3.0
```

## Notes
- Make sure to only input valid mathematical expressions.
- Uses Python’s `eval()`, so be careful with the inputs.

Enjoy your calculations!
